- Every left-paren attends uniformly to the tokens to its right, and stores the `N_( - N_)` information
	- Where `N_(` = number of left parens to the right of that one, etc
- The MLPs can compute the binary information `N_( > N_)` and `N_( < N_)` at each of these sequence positions 
- Head 2.0 is responsible for specifically moving the combined binary information `N_( == N_)` to position zero, i.e. the "net elevation circuit"
- Head 2.1 is responsible for detecting any `N_( > N_)` at any sequence position and classifying the seq as unbalanced if this exists, i.e. the "anywhere negative circuit"
